> Full-stack Developer

Self-taught programmer with experience in a variety of languages including C#, Python, and JavaScript. As a freelancer, I have worked on both front-end and back-end development and am comfortable with agile development methodologies, having implemented websites, app features and mobile applications.

Able to effectively self-manage during independent projects, as well as collaborate as part of a productive team, I am excited to bring my skills and experience to a new challenge and I am confident in my ability to contribute to the success of a project.
